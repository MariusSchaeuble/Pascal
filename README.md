# Pascal

n is the number of lines, s is the space each number takes. 

s should be much greater that the number of digits of the greatest occuring number. 

I used BigInteger, so you can go up to the 1000th line, where the numbers have over 400 digits. 

To display large triangles, I recommend to not use the Windows editor, beacause it limits the characters per line to 1024.
